                <h3>Episode 2</h3>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Episode two of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills had quite a bit going on below the surface. Lisa Rinna and Lisa Vanderpump make further progress on the reconciliation they began in the first episode, while she seems to distance herself from Eileen. Maybe she misses Vanderpump as a friend. Maybe she is working towards a path of increased independence, learning to think on her own and not relying on the advice of Eileen or Vanderpump. Dorit’s relationship with her husband, PK, are at the heart of this episode which centers around the 40th birthday party he throws for her. Their relationship is very sweet, but they both have a tendency to state conclusions about themselves and each other that don’t seem related to anything. Erika continues to grow on me this episode because of her composure, especially when people take snipes at her. Eileen grows more abhorrent to me, and begins to come off not only as uptight and lacking a sense of humor, but also passive aggressive and egocentric. Vanderpump is continuously trying to figure out who her real friends are, and rightly so after her experiences with the women on this show. Speaking of which, Kyle continues to insult Vanderpump in her confessionals. This episode also plants more seed of discontent between Dorit and Erika that it seems will grow into full-blown drama.</p>

<h3>Rinna and Vanderpump</h3>
<p>The first scene shows Kyle driving Rinna in her Lamborghini to go work out. They talk about Erika’s party the night before. Kyle tells Rinna she, Vanderpump, Dorit, and their spouses got cheeseburgers and fries after the party because they were so hungry. Rinna says, “I’m so jealous!” I feel like she is so hungry, not just now, but ALL THE TIME. The scene is supposed to be about Vanderpump and Rinna’s takes on their encounter at Erika’s party in the prior episode; but all I can think about is how much Rinna wants a cheeseburger and fries. Rinna tells Kyle that the party is the first time she has seen Vanderpump since last season, but she would like to reconcile with her. </p>

<p>We then get Vanderpump’s take on their relationship, in a sort of metaphor about animals or something. I’m not sure why we were talking about horses here, but we are. Vanderpump says that she has a new horse, and she likes animals more than she likes people because she can trust animals more. Kyle must have spent 90% of her time in confessionals bitching about Vanderpump: her take on their reconciliation is that, “It wouldn’t make sense if she [Vanderpump] made up with Rinna but not with Eileen.” They both had different issues with Vanderpump, and Vanderpump and Rinna had a prior relationship in which they hung out and got along with each other. I’m not sure what Kyle is talking about here. Vanderpump says that she did not gossip to Dorit about the other ladies, and I actually believe her. I think she knows that their behavior will likely speak for itself. </p>

<h3>Dorit and Her Bentley</h3>
<p>Dorit gets a rose-gold Bentley from her husband for her birthday. They seem to have a very sweet and loving relationship (for now).  But both go on to make platitudinous statements about each other. He says that rose-gold is reflective of Dorit’s personality. Um, okay? And she says that his gift was incredibly thoughtful. A car for your birthday is thoughtful? I’m not sure...maybe because they moved from NYC to LA and she didn’t have a car and now she has one? That would maybe make sense if she didn’t have car - I’m guessing she not only had a car, but also three drivers. </p>

<p>PK saying “baby” all the time, along with his gobs of money, made me want to look into who he is. According to <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kemsley “ target=#>Wikipedia</a>, he is a property developer, not a talent manager, which I think Dorit said he was in the episode one. He has filed for bankruptcy before, and he and Dorit had a <a href=”https://weddingstylemagazine.com/inspiration/real-weddings/twenties-inspired-wedding-rainbow-room-new-york-city “>“lavish”</a> wedding in NYC. Other interesting tidbit: Dorit was Vanderpump’s designer. </p>

<h3>Group Cycling</h3>

<p>Rinna and Kyle arrive at their group rowing class. Oh, you don’t know what this is? Well, I had to <a href=”http://www.metronews.ca/life/health/2015/11/23/group-rowing-is-the-new-spin-class.html “>look it up</a>. As Kyle says, “it’s the newest thing.” It made me laugh condescendingly. It’s like a less loud, less crowded Soul Cycle. I feel like Kyle loves this shit because she really hates exercising and it makes it bearable.  They were joined by Kyle’s daughter, Alexia, who for some reason was doing intense exercise without putting her very long hair in a ponytail. Rinna is rowing clearly on an empty stomach and I just want to give her a burger still. Kyle makes a ridiculous statement: “I live in a town where everyone looks unbelievably good. You would never be able to guess how old they are or how many kids they’ve had. Everyone is a freak of nature...me.” Freak of nature? No. A lot of time and money to exercise or get plastic surgery? Yes. </p>

<h3>Elaine loves Erika</h3>

<p>Elaine gives an interview for the 11,000th episode of the Young and Restless. She continues her run from the previous episode of lavishing praise on Erika. She says, “I want to do an Erika Jane story arc where Ashley [her Young and the Restless character] goes across the country and performs at gay clubs. </p>

<h3>Collective Eyeroll</h3>

<p>At some point after Group Rowing, Rinna is at home with her two daughters. Rinna and her daughter who is trying to be a model, start talking about modeling, and in such a predictably pretentious way. “What did Cindy Crawford say?” she asks her daughter, regarding the advice she apparently gave to her daughter. Rinna’s other daughter then does an eyeroll for us all and says, “I’m getting tired of this conversation.”  We all feel you, girl. </p>

<h3>Another Birthday Party, Another Awkward Vanderpump and Eileen Encounter</h3>
<p>Dorit’s birthday party includes more awkward encounters between Vanderpump and Eileen.  Dorit has two kids under three and she looks amazing and it’s a little hard to believe. But let’s remember that she has a large enough staff that she can be in the party while her kids at home with someone watching them, and her house is large enough for that to happen. Kyle again reminds us that she’s on Celebrity Apprentice. I had thought she was in a prior season since I WOULD NEVER watch that show. But when I was walking down the street in Manhattan last week, I saw her and Boy George on a bus advertisement for the show. She’s in the <a href=”http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/celebrity-apprentice-kyle-richards-porsha-williams-cast “>next season</a>, and she’s making sure to promote that shit. </p>

<p>At the party, Vanderpump and Eileen’s super awkward interaction. Vanderpump approaches Eileen and offers her condolences about her mother’s passing away. Eileen is so awkward when she says this, and physically backs away and laughs. She later approaches Vanderpump and says, “I thought you were going to apologize about disrespecting me last season.” Lisa says what we are all thinking at that point: “Are you out of your mind?! You thought I was going to apologize AGAIN?” </p>

<p>Eileen says, “Shut up,” to her, and Vanderpump says in her confessional, “That’s not going to happen again.” Kyle includes her take on it in her confessional, where she continues her insults towards Lisa: “I just think, overall, I’m more polite than Lisa,” she says. </p>

<h3>The Buddha Lounge</h3>

<p>Dorit’s second birthday surprise (the first was the Bentley), is her backyard converted to a “Buddha Lounge.” Dorit says, “The lights, the music, the colors. How on earth he was able to create what he created in our backyard is astounding!” It’s called money and hiring other people to work. </p>

<p>Rinna embarrasses herself when she says that the party is a 40th birthday party “on fleek.” Rinna then really tries to reconcile with Vanderpump. Thank goodness Eileen’s not around at this point. She would definitely be laughing snidely but obviously. Rinna tells Vanderpump, “I like you more than I don’t...I’m sorry for being hard on you.” I think she missed Vanderpump and their friendship, and realized Eileen isn’t worth it. Vanderpump says, “I never thought I’d get an apology from Rinna, so this modicum of remorse give me some home for the future with her.” </p>

<p>Vanderpump and Eileen’s relationship conversely goes backwards. Vanderpump approaches Dorit and Eileen, who are in conversation. Eileen then passive aggressively tries to leave, saying she’ looking for her husband. I’m sure that this hurt Vanderpump’s feelings, along with their awkward interaction where Eileen STILL wants Vanderpump to apologize for something so stupid. Vanderpump says, “I saw him in the corner with his head up some girl’s skirt.” </p>

<p>Eileen, of course, can’t wait to tell Rinna and Kyle what Vanderpump said. She neglects to mention her own awkward and passive aggressive behavior. She says, “I have a good sense of humor, I think I also have a pretty good idea of who Vanderpump is.” My take is that she definitely doesn’t have a good sense of humor, and her problem is that she takes herself way too seriously. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dorit says that PK has a very, “beautiful way of showing his love to me.” So in this context, she’s referring to money, parties, and a car. Another eyeroll to Dorit here. </p>

<p>Erika also sort of snaps at PK’s husband at the end of this episode, foreshadowing future conflict between her and Dorit. PK starts to define “banter” and she says, “We know what banter is. We’re American; we’re not stupid.” </p>
